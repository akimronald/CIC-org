                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">15th – 17th Nov 2023 </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">A three days collaborative project aimed at empowering women in the fields of phone and inventor repair was recently organized, with the support of ROG Agency and funding from the German government. The project was led by CC4D, with CIC responsible for training the participants and PA documenting the entire initiative.
The project brought together 16 women who were trained on phone and inventor repair over a specific period. The training covered various aspects of repair, including troubleshooting, disassembling, reassembling, and testing devices to ensure they were functioning correctly. The participants were also taught about safety measures to take when handling electronic devices during repair.
On the third day of the project, an exhibition was held, which was attended by 35 participants. The exhibition showcased the skills and knowledge acquired by the women during the training. Participants displayed repaired phones and inventors, demonstrating their newly acquired skills. The exhibition provided an opportunity for the trainees to interact with other professionals in the field, exchange ideas, and build networks that could lead to future collaborations.
PA’s space served as the venue for the project’s training and exhibition. PA’s space is a well-known hub for innovation and creativity, providing a conducive environment for learning and experimentation. The space was equipped with all the necessary tools and equipment required for the training, ensuring that the participants had a hands-on experience during the training sessions.
ROG Agency’s support for the project is a testament to its commitment to promoting gender equality in various sectors. By funding this initiative, ROG Agency has helped provide an opportunity for women to acquire new skills and knowledge in a field that has traditionally been dominated by men. The German government’s funding of the project is also commendable as it demonstrates its recognition of the importance of empowering women economically through skills development.
CIC’s role in providing training for the project was crucial to its success. With its expertise in training and capacity building, CIC was able to equip the participants with the necessary skills required to excel in phone and inventor repair. The training sessions were interactive and practical, enabling participants to learn through doing.
CC4D’s leadership of the project ensured that all partners worked together towards achieving a common goal. As the lead partner, CC4D was responsible for coordinating all activities related to the project, including planning, implementation, and monitoring. CC4D’s experience in managing similar projects enabled it to provide effective leadership throughout the project’s duration.

The project aimed to educate youths on utilizing renewable solar energy and up-cycling e-waste within the Omugo Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement. It was a collaborative effort involving teachers and students from St. Luke Widi Secondary School.
The activity took place at the AVIS office in Omugo, providing a conducive environment for learning and practical demonstrations.
The primary goal of the project was to empower the youth with knowledge and skills in renewable energy technologies, specifically focusing on solar inverters. By incorporating e-waste up-cycling, the initiative also promoted environmental sustainability within the refugee settlement.
The project involved hands-on workshops where participants learned how to build solar inverters using recycled materials. This practical approach not only enhanced their technical skills but also instilled a sense of creativity and innovation.
Through this project, the youths were able to grasp the concepts of solar energy utilization and e-waste management. They gained valuable experience in constructing solar inverters, which could potentially benefit the community by providing clean and sustainable energy solutions.
The Building a Solar Inverter Project in Omugo Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement successfully engaged teachers and students in promoting renewable energy awareness and e-waste upcycling. By empowering the youth with practical skills, the project contributed to a more sustainable future for the community.

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">1st – 2nd June 2023</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">At Creative Innovation Centre, we are dedicated to nurturing the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers. Through our school visit workshops at Ofua Community Secondary School and St. Luke Widi Secondary School in June 2023, we had the opportunity to ignite curiosity and passion for technology among students.
Our workshops focused on electronics and programming, aiming to equip students with practical skills and knowledge essential for the 21st-century workforce. We believe in fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities through hands-on activities and engaging sessions.
During the workshops, students delved into the world of physics, exploring its real-world applications. They gained practical insights into electronic components, learning how to assemble and utilize them effectively. With exercises using Arduino and related platforms, students expanded their ICT knowledge and engaged in programming tasks, fostering their technical skills.
The workshops were designed to accommodate students with varying levels of experience, from beginners to those with prior knowledge. Through interactive sessions, students had the opportunity to collaborate with peers and teachers, working on exciting projects and seeking guidance along the way.
Not only did these workshops benefit students, but they also provided valuable insights for teachers, expanding their understanding of the practical aspects of physics and ICT. We firmly believe that such initiatives play a crucial role in supplementing students' educational journey, preparing them for the challenges of the future workforce.
By immersing themselves in electronics and programming, students did not only acquire technical knowledge but also developed essential skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. These skills are vital for success in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
At CIC, we remain committed to empowering youth through technology and education. We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Ofua Community Secondary School and St. Luke Widi Secondary School, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to inspire and educate tomorrow's innovators. Together, we can build a brighter future fueled by curiosity, creativity, and continuous learning.

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">12th – 20th January 2023</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">At Creative Innovation Centre (C.I.C), we believe in the transformative power of technology to address pressing global challenges. Yet, for many youths living in refugee camps, access to technology and training remains limited. Recognizing this need, we organized a two-day workshop aimed at equipping young individuals with essential skills in technology.
Our workshops held in Ofua zone, Rhino camp refugee settlement, focused on basic electronics and programming, with a special emphasis on sensor usage. Through this initiative, we aimed not only to provide technical education but also to foster peace and collaboration among youths from different villages within the camp.
Led by the main facilitator Kwaje Steven Taban and supported by the dedicated C.I.C team, the workshop welcomed 17 participants from various villages in Ofua zone. The workshop garnered significant participation, with attendees expressing enthusiasm and appreciation for the interactive group projects.
Feedback from participants underscored the workshop's success, with many highlighting the practical relevance of the training to their daily lives. From understanding oscillation to its real-life applications, the workshop provided valuable insights for participants, especially secondary school students seeking to bridge theory with practice.
As we continue our mission to empower refugee youths through technology, we remain committed to providing opportunities for skill development, mentorship, and guidance. By investing in the potential of these young individuals, we not only equip them for success but also contribute to building a more inclusive and prosperous future for all
